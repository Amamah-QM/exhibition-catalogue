The most renowned Romantic painter of the nineteenth century, Delacroix saw the ‘East’ as wild, unbound and unsullied.

In his work, we see an artist striving to convey ‘real people’ in his depictions of the ‘East’, yet he is responsible for Orientalist stereotypes that have persevered to the present day.

Delacroix and his contemporaries were fascinated by the Arabian horse and rider as emblematic of the ‘wild East’. This fascination persists globally today.

The war of Greek independence inspired in Delacroix a changed perspective on the Hellenic Republic – as a cradle of civilisation distinct from the rest of the ‘East’.

Delacroix’s initial Orientalist works relied on second-hand accounts and imported objects. He eventually travelled to North Africa during the French colonisation of Algeria. This formative experience shifted his perspective again – he started to perceive the origins of art and civilisation outside of the neoclassical Roman and Greek canon.

Despite rejecting the historical fantasies pervasive in Orientalist representation, Delacroix established many of the major tropes that would go on to become stereotypes perpetuated by Orientalism.

Louis-François Cassas was a distinguished French landscape painter, sculptor, architect, archeologist and antiquary born at Azay-le-Ferron, in the Indre Department of France. His father was an artisan in the office of the "Ponts et Chaussés", and Cassas followed him there as an apprentice draughtsman when he was only fifteen years old.

From Constantinople, Cassas travelled extensively in the Levant in 1784-7, making some 250 drawings of the antiquities. These were later published with the assistance of Choiseul-Gouffier under Cassas's name in the 'Voyage pittoresque de la Syrie, de la Phénicie, de la Palestine et de la Basse-Egypte', Paris 1799. This book was never completed, and only 30 livraisons of plates and part of the text was published. After his return to France in 1792, Cassas was appointed drawing master at the Gobelins.

This work by French painter Jean-Léon Gérôme is a beautiful depiction of a musician. It is so realistic, one might think it captures a particular moment in time. But like many Orientalist painters, Gérôme often painted from his studio, where he employed models to pose, and drew inspiration from photographs or artefacts he had collected on his travels.
