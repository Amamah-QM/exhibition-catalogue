What do we mean by ‘Orientalism’?

Orientalism refers to ‘Western’ representations, imitations and, often, misinterpretations of the ‘Eastern’ world.

In art we might find this through the medium of paintings, sketches, photographs, ceramics or fashion.

This work by French painter Jean-Léon Gérôme is a beautiful depiction of a musician. It is so realistic, one might think it captures a particular moment in time. But like many Orientalist painters, Gérôme often painted from his studio, where he employed models to pose, and drew inspiration from photographs or artefacts he had collected on his travels.

Jean-Léon Gérôme (11 May 1824 – 10 January 1904) was a French painter and sculptor in the style now known as academicism. His paintings were so widely reproduced that he was "arguably the world's most famous living artist by 1880." The range of his oeuvre included historical painting, Greek mythology, Orientalism, portraits, and other subjects, bringing the academic painting tradition to an artistic climax. He is considered one of the most important painters from this academic period. He was also a teacher with a long list of students.

What stories do we remember, and which histories are forgotten?

The tragic love story of Antony and Cleopatra played out only a few years before Amanirenas, Queen of the Kingdom of Kush (in present-day Sudan and southern Egypt), victoriously led her armies against Rome. One story has been celebrated and reinterpreted endlessly in the West – from Shakespeare to Hollywood – while one has been overlooked. In this painting, artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema exploits his preference for historical and exotic themes in a work commissioned by Queen Victoria of England herself.

The painter was born in Dronryp, the Netherlands, and trained at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium, he settled in London, England in 1870 and spent the rest of his life there. A classical-subject painter, he became famous for his depictions of the luxury and decadence of the Roman Empire, with languorous figures set in fabulous marbled interiors or against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean Sea and sky. Alma-Tadema was considered one of the most popular Victorian painters.
