This is a student-built catalogue for Lusail Museum's *Tales of a Connected World* exhibition. The purpose of this catalogue is to test the functionality and viability of Quire as a publishing platform.

The text excerpts are a mix of Wikipedia, Medium, the British Museum and Lusail Museum's own content, and are not meant for commercial use.

The images have all been taken from Lusail Museum's online gallery.
